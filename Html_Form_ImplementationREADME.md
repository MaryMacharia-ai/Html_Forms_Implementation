# Html_Forms_Implementation
This is my first HTML form implementation based on given outlined structure
# Purpose of the form and its sections
It is a user registration form for the specific firm to gather information concerning the user of their services. 
The first section requests for the user personal information (First Name, Last Name,Date of Birth, Age, Gender and Profile Photo.
The Second section requests user's contact and address information (Email Address, Phone Number, Personal Website, Street Address, City, Country, Zip/Postal Code, and Preferred Contact Time).
The third section request for the user's Preferences and Interests (Favorite Color, Experience Level, Birth Month, Available Week and Search Keywords).
The forth section is for Feedback & Additional Information (Tell us about Yourself, Suggestion for improvement, Registration Date & Time, How did you hear about us?, Upload Resume (Optional), Subscribe to our newsletter, I agree to the Terms and Conditions, and I agree to the Privacy Policy).
Finally, there is the fifth section for user to submit your registration through "Register" button after successfully completion of the form. It also has a Clear Form reset button that allows one to start over or remove all written sections automatically. 
# File structure explanation
used <!DOCTYPE html> to that allows the browser to utilize HTML5 standards.
Input a <html lang="en"> that indicates its a HTML root element that makes it for screen readers and search engines
I have the 
<head> that has the metadata:
<meta charset="UTF-8">: for appropriate character encoding.
<meta name="viewport"...>: to ensure the page responds even on mobile.
<title> - Sets the browser tab title.
<style> - To document styles
There is then the <body> that held every visible content.
For example; 
a. <header> - displaying form title “User Registration Form”.
b. <form> - Serves as the primary container to collect user input.
the form is divided into 4 fieldset each with inputs mentioned in the form section mentioned above: 
i. <fieldset> -Personal Information
ii. <fieldset> - Contact & Address Information
iii. <fieldset> - Preferences & Interests
iv. <fieldset> - Feedback & Additional Information
Finally, there is the 
a. Form Buttons "submit" type that allows the user to send the form data.
b. Clear Form button that "reset" all fields to default.
