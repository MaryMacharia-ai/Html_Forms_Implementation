# Html_Forms_Implementation
This is my first HTML form implementation based on given outlined structure
# Purpose of the form and its sections
It is a user registration form for the specific firm to gather information concerning the user of their services. 
The first section requests for the user personal information (First Name, Last Name,Date of Birth, Age, Gender and Profile Photo.
The Second section requests user's contact and address information (Email Address, Phone Number, Personal Website, Street Address, City, Country, Zip/Postal Code, and Preferred Contact Time).
The third section request for the user's Preferences and Interests (Favorite Color, Experience Level, Birth Month, Available Week and Search Keywords).
The forth section is for Feedback & Additional Information (Tell us about Yourself, Suggestion for improvement, Registration Date & Time, How did you hear about us?, Upload Resume (Optional), Subscribe to our newsletter, I agree to the Terms and Conditions, and I agree to the Privacy Policy).
Finally, there is the fifth section for user to submit your registration through "Register" button after successfully completion of the form. It also has a Clear Form reset button that allows one to start over or remove all written sections automatically.
